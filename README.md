#  SoC 2k23 - Image Processing and Object Detection


## 1) Learning the basics of Python, Numpy, OpenCV

The week 1 was comprised of learning through the given resources and the other extra documentation.

##

## 2) Testing after the basics of Python and OpenCV

-   **Demo Project - Money Counter** (To implement both **edge detection** and **get no. of objects**) (video of demo provided)
  
    - Used guassian blur and canny edge detection functions to convert the feed from camera of phone to get only the edges of coins.
    - Basically detects the number of objects/circles in the screen.
    - Then based upon the area of the circle(edge of the coin) (PS - which was caliberated before hand in code), it detects the type/value of the coin.
    - Then the value of the coins is added up after every refresh. (the video demo of the final working testing model is also provided in the repo).
